# Steam Screenshot Downloader
This is an old project that I made a couple years ago. I reworked some of the code to be faster and better, hopefully it's useful to someone!
<br>
This basically downloads the public screenshots of a specified user and specified game to your computer. Its useful if you end up deleting the screenshot directory for whatever reason, but uploaded the images to Steam Cloud.
<br>
Note that it only works on public images, so you will have to set all the ones you want to download to public.
<br> Modify the userId and appId field to your userId and the game that you want to download (0 for all images). Your user ID can be found from the screenshots page: https://steamcommunity.com/id/{userID}/screenshots/
